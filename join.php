               <b>  If so, join as a Contributor! </b><br><br>
                
                   As a Contributor, you would: <br>
                   1. Register with us.<br> 2. Gather lost property or items no
longer in use from your school,
your friends and your own home. <br>

Inventory page.<br>

EnviroFound's Inventory.<br> 5. Once your items are requested by a Distributor, put them in a carton and label with the
